# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# Backend API URL (e.g., local backend or Railway deployment)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
# For production, use your Railway backend URL WITHOUT /api at the end:
# VITE_API_URL=https://vercel-frontend-production.up.railway.app
# IMPORTANT: 
# 1. Replace 'vercel-frontend-production' with your real Railway app name
# 2. DO NOT include /api at the end - the API calls will add it automatically
# 3. Ensure your Railway backend has CORS configured for your Vercel domain

# Optional: Analytics or other services
